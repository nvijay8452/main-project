	One of the greatest advantages of travel is that it takes you on a journey into new worlds that you would have never been exposed to. Traveling allows you to meet people of different cultures, with diverse traditions and distinctive lifestyles. As you travel and discover these newly found worlds, take a moment to reflect not only on the differences that you observe in their lifestyle and behavior but on the things that unite us. This practice will not only broaden your mind but will allow your authentic self to surface.

	India is one of the popular tourist destination in Asia. Bounded by the Himalayan ranges in the north and surrounded, on three sides by water (Arabian sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean), India offers a wide array of places to see and things to do. The enchanting backwaters, hill stations and landscapes make India a beautiful country.
